# Lesson 1: Analysis & Design Thinking

In this lesson, we will learn **how to take a problem and break it down into smaller, solvable parts** using a simplified version of **Design Thinking**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the **Empathise – Define – Ideate** mini-cycle
- Know how to **analyse a problem** before jumping into building a solution
- Be able to **ask the right questions** to get useful information
- Identify **pain points** in a process

## 🧠 What is Design Thinking?

**Design Thinking** is a structured approach to solving problems creatively.  
It’s widely used in industry to design **solutions that work for people** – not just technology.

We will use a **3-step mini-cycle**:
1. **Empathise** – Understand the people and the problem
2. **Define** – Clearly describe the problem
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm possible solutions

> 💡 The full industry version has 5 stages (Empathise – Define – Ideate – Prototype – Test). We are starting with 3 to make it simpler. Prototype and Test will happen later in the Design and Development lessons.

## 1️⃣ Empathise – Understand the Problem
Before you can solve a problem, you must **see it from the user’s perspective**.

**How to do it:**
- Talk to the people who experience the problem
- Ask open-ended questions (not just “yes/no”)
- Observe how the process works in real life
- Look for frustration points, delays, or repetitive work

**Questions to ask:**
- Who is involved in this process?
- What steps do they take?
- What is frustrating about this process?
- What happens if something goes wrong?

---

## 2️⃣ Define – Describe the Problem Clearly
Once you’ve gathered information, **turn it into a clear problem statement**.

**Example:**
- **Bad:** "The report is a mess."
- **Good:** "The monthly sales report takes 3 hours to prepare because data from 4 spreadsheets has to be copied manually."

**Tips:**
- Be specific (who, what, when, why)
- Focus on the **root cause**, not just the symptoms

---

## 3️⃣ Ideate – Think of Possible Solutions
Now that you understand the problem, **brainstorm ideas**.  
The goal here is **quantity**, not quality – we’ll refine later.

**Rules for brainstorming:**
- No idea is too silly at this stage
- Build on other people’s ideas
- Avoid saying “That won’t work” – instead ask “How could we make this work?”

## 🛠 Breaking Problems into Consumable Parts
In industry, we often break a big problem into **small, manageable parts**.

### Example:
**Big problem:** Students wait weeks for exam results.  
**Broken down:**
1. Data entry from exam scripts is slow  
2. Marks are sent between departments manually  
3. Results are released one batch at a time

By solving **just one part** (e.g., automating data entry), we can already make a big impact.

---

## 📌 Activity
We will:
1. **Pick a simple, real-life problem** from your college or community
2. Interview at least **one person** involved
3. Write a **Problem Statement**
4. Brainstorm at least **3 possible solutions**

Bring your notes to the next session – we’ll use them to map the **current process flow**.

✅ **Next Step:** Move on to [Lesson 2: Design](03-Design.md) to learn how to map out processes and visualise improvements.
