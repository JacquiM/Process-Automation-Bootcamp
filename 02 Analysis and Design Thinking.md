# Lesson 1: Analysis & Design Thinking

In this lesson, we will learn **how to take a problem and break it down into smaller, solvable parts** using a simplified version of **Design Thinking**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the **Empathise – Define – Ideate** mini-cycle
- Know how to **analyse a problem** before jumping into building a solution
- Be able to **ask the right questions** to get useful information
- Identify **pain points** in a process

---

## 🧠 What is Design Thinking?

**Design Thinking** is a structured approach to solving problems creatively.  
It’s widely used in industry to design **solutions that work for people** – not just technology.

We will use a **3-step mini-cycle**:
1. **Empathise** – Understand the people and the problem
2. **Define** – Clearly describe the problem
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm possible solutions

---

## 1️⃣ Empathise – Understand the Problem
**How to do it:**
- Talk to the people who experience the problem
- Ask open-ended questions
- Observe how the process works in real life
- Look for frustration points, delays, or repetitive work

---

## 2️⃣ Define – Describe the Problem Clearly
**Example:**
- **Bad:** "The report is a mess."
- **Good:** "The monthly sales report takes 3 hours to prepare because data from 4 spreadsheets has to be copied manually."

---

## 3️⃣ Ideate – Think of Possible Solutions
**Rules for brainstorming:**
- No idea is too silly at this stage
- Build on other people’s ideas
- Avoid saying “That won’t work” – instead ask “How could we make this work?”

---

## 🧩 Breaking Problems into Consumable Parts
**Example:**
Big problem: Students wait weeks for exam results.  
Broken down:
1. Data entry from scripts is slow  
2. Marks sent manually between departments  
3. Results released in batches

---

## 🏋️ Activities – Analysis & Design Thinking

1. **Pick a Problem**
   - Identify one process from your college or community that frustrates people.
2. **Empathise**
   - Interview at least 1 person who is affected by the problem.
3. **Define**
   - Write a clear **problem statement** (one sentence).
4. **Ideate**
   - List 3 possible solutions.
5. **Upload**
   - Save your notes in GitHub as `lesson-2-analysis.md`.
