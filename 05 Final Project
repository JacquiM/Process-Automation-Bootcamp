# Final Project – Process Automation Bootcamp

## 📋 Project Brief
For your final project, you will **apply everything you have learned** during the bootcamp to solve a real-world problem using the Microsoft Power Platform.

Your project must:
1. **Analyse** a problem using the Empathise – Define – Ideate approach.
2. **Map** the current (As-Is) and improved (To-Be) process flows.
3. **Develop** an automation using Power Automate (and optionally Power Apps or Power BI).
4. **Document** your work and push all deliverables to GitHub.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Demonstrate **problem-solving skills**.
- Apply **process mapping techniques** to communicate solutions clearly.
- Build an **automation** that improves efficiency or removes manual work.
- Present your work in a **professional portfolio format**.

---

## 🛠 Allowed Tools
- **Draw.io (Diagrams.net)** – process mapping
- **Microsoft Power Platform** – Power Automate, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Virtual Agents
- **SharePoint** – data storage
- **GitHub** – project documentation

---

## 📂 Deliverables
Your GitHub repository must include:

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Problem statement
   - Empathise notes (interviews/observations)
   - List of possible solutions

2. **Process Design**
   - As-Is process diagram (PNG)
   - To-Be process diagram (PNG)

3. **Automation**
   - Screenshots of Power Automate flow
   - Screenshots of test run (e.g., email received, data updated)
   - Optional: Power Apps screen(s) or Power BI report screenshot(s)

4. **Documentation**
   - This `final-project.md` filled out
   - Any extra notes or files that support your project

## 📌 Project Steps

### Step 1 – Choose a Problem
Pick a process from your college, community, or personal life that:
- Has **repetitive manual steps**
- Involves **more than one person/system**
- Could be **improved with automation**

**Examples:**
- Submitting and approving maintenance requests
- Recording attendance for events
- Sending reminders for overdue books
- Tracking assignment submissions

---

### Step 2 – Analyse the Problem
1. **Empathise** – Talk to 1–2 people who use or run this process.
2. **Define** – Write a clear problem statement.
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm at least 3 possible solutions.

---

### Step 3 – Map the Process
1. Create an **As-Is** process diagram.
2. Create a **To-Be** process diagram showing improvements and automation.

---

### Step 4 – Build the Automation
1. Use Power Automate (or Power Apps, Power BI) to create your solution.
2. Test it with real or sample data.
3. Take screenshots of your working automation.

---

### Step 5 – Submit Your Project
1. Push all files, diagrams, and screenshots to your GitHub repository.
2. Fill out the **Project Summary** section below.
3. Share your GitHub repo link with your facilitator.

## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on:
- **Clarity of problem statement** (10%)
- **Completeness of process mapping** (20%)
- **Functionality of automation** (40%)
- **Documentation & presentation** (20%)
- **Creativity & practicality of solution** (10%)

---

## ✅ Pro Tips for Success
- Keep your problem **small and focused** – you only have to automate part of it.
- Test your automation multiple times before submission.
- Make your diagrams **clear and neat** – presentation matters in industry.
- Use **meaningful names** for your flow, lists, and files.
