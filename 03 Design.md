# Lesson 2: Design – Mapping Processes

In this lesson, we will learn how to **visualise a process** so that everyone can understand it, spot inefficiencies, and plan improvements.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand **As-Is** (current) and **To-Be** (future) process flows
- Know how to use **Draw.io** to create process maps
- Recognise **common process mapping symbols**
- Create a process diagram that clearly explains the flow

---

## 📍 As-Is vs To-Be

**As-Is Process**
- Shows the current reality  
- Includes all steps (even if inefficient)  

**To-Be Process**
- Shows the improved or automated process  
- Removes unnecessary steps  
- Adds automation

---

## 🔹 Common Process Mapping Symbols (Lite BPMN)
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⭕ Start Event | where the process begins |
| 🔷 Activity | an action that is done |
| ⬛ Decision | a yes/no or condition-based choice |
| 🔴 End Event | where the process finishes |
| ➡ Arrow | shows direction of flow |

---

## 🏋️ Activities – Design

1. **As-Is Process**
   - Create a diagram of the current process.
   - Use at least 1 Start Event, 3 Activities, 1 Decision, and 1 End Event.
2. **To-Be Process**
   - Copy the As-Is diagram and improve it.
   - Show at least 1 automation step.
3. **Save & Upload**
   - Export both diagrams as PNG and upload to GitHub in a `diagrams` folder.
4. **Reflection**
   - In your `my-learning-journal.md`, write 2–3 sentences about what improved in the To-Be process.
