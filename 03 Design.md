# Lesson 2: Design – Mapping Processes

In this lesson, we will learn how to **visualise a process** so that everyone can understand it, spot inefficiencies, and plan improvements.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand **As-Is** (current) and **To-Be** (future) process flows
- Know how to use **Draw.io** to create process maps
- Recognise **common process mapping symbols**
- Create a process diagram that clearly explains the flow

---

## 📍 Why Process Mapping Matters

Process maps are like **blueprints** for a solution.  
They help:
- Understand **how things work today** (As-Is)
- Design **how things should work in the future** (To-Be)
- Communicate ideas to stakeholders clearly

---

## 🗺 As-Is vs To-Be

### **As-Is Process**
- Shows the current reality
- Includes **all steps** (even if inefficient or manual)
- Helps identify pain points and bottlenecks

### **To-Be Process**
- Shows the **improved** or **automated** process
- Removes unnecessary steps
- Adds automation and new tools

**Example:**
- **As-Is:** Staff manually type customer info into Excel → Email it to manager → Manager updates another system
- **To-Be:** Customer fills online form → Data flows directly into the system → Manager is notified automatically

## 🔹 Common Process Mapping Symbols (Lite BPMN)

We will use a **simplified BPMN** style, which is common in industry:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⭕ **Start Event** – where the process begins |
| 🔷 **Activity / Task** – an action that is done |
| ⬛ **Decision / Gateway** – a yes/no or condition-based choice |
| 🔴 **End Event** – where the process finishes |
| ➡ **Arrow** – shows the direction of the flow |

## 🛠 How to Map in Draw.io

### Step 1: Open Draw.io
- Go to [https://app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)
- Select **Device** or **OneDrive** to save your work

### Step 2: Choose a Template
- Start with a **Blank Diagram**
- Drag shapes from the **General** or **Flowchart** sections

### Step 3: Map Your As-Is Process
1. Add a **Start Event** (circle)
2. Add each **Activity** (rounded rectangle) in the order it happens
3. Use **Decision** (diamond) for points where a choice is made
4. End with an **End Event** (circle with bold border)
5. Connect everything with **arrows**

### Step 4: Map Your To-Be Process
- Copy your As-Is diagram
- Remove unnecessary steps
- Add automation tasks (e.g., “Send automated email”)
- Show improvements clearly

## 🧩 Example

**As-Is:**


**To-Be:**


---

## 📌 Activity
1. Take your **problem statement** from Lesson 1.
2. Map out the **As-Is** process in Draw.io.
3. Create a second diagram for the **To-Be** process.
4. Save both diagrams (PNG or PDF) – we will use these in the **Development** lesson.

✅ **Next Step:** Move on to [Lesson 3: Development](04-Development.md) to learn how to build and automate your To-Be process using the Microsoft Power Platform.
